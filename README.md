**Multi-Sided Dice Roller

This is a small personal project I built for skill upkeep, experimenting in JS and developing tools that I (and others!) can use in game design. Whether for testing or playing, my hope is to create a suite of tools that mitigate the time spent playtesting pencil and paper rules by using simulators and functions to better balance the game before presenting it to players.

Excited to keep developing tools here and to upgrade and polish existing tools.
